PGP public key
--------------

My public key has been uploaded to the [MIT PGP public key server][mitpks] (and
therefore all connected keyservers). Currently I am using PGP key
[4C86103A][4C86103A].  [A551209B][A551209B] is an old key and has been revoked
as of 2015-07-07. Please send me encrypted mail, and verify my signatures if I
send you anything!

If you don't know what PGP is, but are interested in learning how to make
your email more secure, you may find the following link helpful:
[How PGP works][pgpexp]. I have used [Enigmail][enigmail] with
[Thunderbird][thunderbird] in the past, but am currently using
[Mailvelope][mailvelope] in [Firefox][firefox].
