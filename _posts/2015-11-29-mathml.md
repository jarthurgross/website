Over the Summer [MathML][mathml] was announced as an ISO/IEC International
Standard.[^announce] I was delighted by the news, since it might encourage
better browser support for MathML (currently only Firefox has tolerable MathML
support). I have been surprised, however, by how apathetic (and sometimes
hostile) the community of math users on the web seems to be toward increasing
this support. Much of the apathy/hostility seems to stem from a belief that math
on the web is "good enough" as it is, largely as a result of the success of the
[MathJax][mathjax] project. I am a huge fan of what MathJax has accomplished,
but I thought it might be useful to outline why I still think native MathML
support in browsers is important.

Case study: Wikipedia
---------------------

One hotbed of controversy regarding MathML and MathJax is Wikipedia. Sometime in
the last couple months I noticed that Wikipedia switched from offering logged-in
users math displayed with MathJax to math displayed with MathML. Searching
around to find out more about this shift, I discovered a related task[^task] on
the [Wikimedia Phabricator][wikiphab]. In the conversation, one of the user gave
several reasons why MathML support is desireable:[^desiremathml]

> having accessible, fast to render, standards-compliant math are also valuable
> aspects that will feed a number of ecosystems. Having an HTML5 native solution
> is definitely the way to go forward in my mind.

At odds with these goals of accessibility, speed, and standards compliance is
the fact that most browsers won't natively display the MathML, so without
MathJax they are left with the rather ugly PNG math presentation. One of the
other commentators on the task expressed his frustration with that state of
affairs in a reply to the above comment:[^frustration]

> problem, which is the not-logged-in view. MathML will never be the
> not-logged-in view and any developer work spent improving MathML is developer
> work wasted on not addressing the actual issue.

Fostering adoption
------------------

This highlights the "chicken-and-egg" problem inherent in getting MathML
adoption: websites are not motivated to commit to MathML because browser
support is so poor, and browsers don't seem to be putting a lot of work into
MathML because it is used so infrequently. A recent article in
*[I Programmer][iprog]* suggested that MathJax itself is making browser developers
ignore MathML:[^iprog]

> Now we know why browser makers are ignoring MathML. JavaScript in the form of
> MathJax does the job for them.

While I think the above statement is accurate, I don't think blame should be
leveled entirely at MathJax. The MathJax project lead offered a comment on the
*I Programmer* article intending to clarify the goals of MathJax in relation to
MathML:[^mathjaxlead]

One of the ways MathJax appears to make the transition to MathML difficult is
that it allows websites to present math in LaTeX format, which MathJax then
interprets and displays using HTML and CSS. This is how
[MathOverflow][mathoverflow] works, for instance. An alternative (while still
using MathJax) is to present math as MathML and have MathJax interpret that
(like [this][modsurface] mathematics paper). Math presented in this second way
is ready for a day when there is ubiquitous native MathML support, while math
presented in the first way is dependent on MathJax.

The MathML interpreted by MathJax also allows those of us using Firefox to take
advantage of the speed advantage of native MathML support. The above paper takes
forever to load using MathJax, but using the
[MathJax Native MathML][nativemathml] Add-on bypasses MathJax and allows me to
load the paper almost instantly. When I see comments like "We believe the needs
of MathML can be sufficiently met by libraries like MathJax and doesn't need to
be more directly supported by the platform.",[^chromium] the biggest point of
disagreement I have concerns rendering speed. I regularly run across papers that
take an unacceptably long amount of time to load with MathJax, and do lots of
symbolic calculations with [Sympy][sympy] in the [Jupyter][jupyter] notebook
that suffer from the same sluggish rendering times.

Usability
---------

Another point made by the *I Programmer* article is that MathML is terrible to
write:[^iprog]

> At this point you might want to object that verbosity is irrelevant because
> both MathML and LaTeX are going to be generated by programs. What might
> surprise you is that a large number of mathematicians write LaTeX almost as
> their first language.  In this case it does matter how verbose a notation is.

As a theoretical physicist, I identify as someone who writes LaTeX almost as my
first language, and yet I find this point irrelevant. I have never coded up a
MathML formula by hand, yet I use MathML in many of my presentations. Tools like
[pandoc][pandoc] and Jupyter allow me to write math as LaTeX and copy it as
MathML for use in web-based contexts. MathML is also capable of storing
semantic information about formulae that might be ambiguous in LaTeX, so if I
generate MathML with a package like Sympy and post it on my website, it is
conceivable that someone could copy the formula and put it directly into another
program. This difference between LaTeX (as simply a formatting language) and
MathML (able to retain semantic information) is a big reason why LaTeX alone is
not a solution for math on the web, despite some suggestions to the contrary.

Conclusions
-----------

I hope the recent ISO/IEC standardization of MathML will encourage browsers to
take MathML more seriously, and that sites using MathJax will transition to
serving their content as MathML rather than raw LaTeX, so that MathJax can more
successfully fulfill its original goal of transitioning the web to MathML. I
know the MathML support Firefox provides has made my experience with math in the
browser much more pleasant than relying on MathJax for everything.

As I was writing this article, I realized that I was as guilty as everyone else
of using raw LaTeX interpreted by MathJax on my site. In order to practice what
I'm preaching, I have taken the step to present my mathematical content in
MathML, which is then interpreted by MathJax to give cross-browser
compatibility. Now when I load my [first blog post][firstpost] in Firefox, the
[MathJax Native MathML][nativemathml] plugin gives me a fast, browser-native
presentation of my equations! The best part was that all I had to do was change
out the pandoc `--mathjax` option for `--mathml` in my jekyll `_config.yml`. If
you serve mathematical content on your site, I encourage you to take a similar
step!
