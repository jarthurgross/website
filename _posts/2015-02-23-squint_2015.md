This last weekend I had the privilege to present some recent work at the 17th
annual Southwest Quantum Information and Technology ([SQuInT][squint]) workshop
in Berkeley, CA. The focus of the work is to evaluate some claims about the
importance of using weak measurements for the purposes of tomography. I made the
slides in HTML and recorded myself giving the presentation so that I could post
the talk directly on my website, and the result is fairly satisfactory.

For this presentation I used [`deck.js`][deck]. I've made HTML slideshows using
[`S5`][S5] and [`reveal.js`][reveal] before and think there are a lot of reasons
to create slideshows in a cross-platform, web-friendly format. I chose
`deck.js` for this presentation because I had recently been made aware
of the [`deck.browsercast.js`][deckbrowsercast] plugin, which will play back an
audio recording of you giving the presentation while changing the slides at the
appropriate time (like a screencast, only better). Turns out
[Browsercast][browsercast] will also work for `reveal.js`, but I
didn't realize this at the start.

Long story short, I created `deck.js` slides for my presentation,
recorded myself presenting, made a file recording when the slide transitions
were supposed to happen, and included the
`deck.browsercast.js` extension files to get my browsercast
ready for publishing. You can watch the finished result [here][talk]!

There are still a few hiccups. For some reason, the play button doesn't work to
pause the presentation. You can still play/pause using the spacebar, but I
haven't had time to figure out exactly why the button can't be pressed. I also
used [MathML][mathml] for the equations in my slides. This let me set parts of
my equations to arbitrary colors, but it also means that it requires a browser
with good MathML support (Firefox does beautifully, but Chrome not so much, even
thought MathML is part of the [HTML5 recommendation][htmlmathml]). MathJax works
better in a cross-browser way, but it is much more limited in the colors I can
apply to individual elements in my equations. The final sacrifice I had to make
in the browsercast is changing all my graphics from [SVG][svg]s to [PNG][png]s.
This is a limitation of hosting my website on the UNM servers. SVGs show up fine
for me when I locally build my site, but then won't appear when I deploy.

I'll be giving an [abbreviated version][apstalk] of this talk at the [APS March
Meeting][marchmeet], so maybe I'll be able to smooth a few things out with this
process before then.
